911 Calls Data Analysis

Overview
This project analyzes 911 emergency call data to uncover trends and patterns in call types, times, and locations. Using Python and  libraries like matplotlib , seaborn and pandas within a Jupyter Notebook, I visualized and interpreted public safety data to provide insights for emergency response.

Features:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values and extract relevant features (e.g., Reason, Hour, Day of Week, Month)
Exploratory Data Analysis: Distribution of call reasons (EMS, Fire, Traffic, etc.) Time series analysis by hour, day of the week, and month , Geographic mapping of call locations

Visualizations:
Count plots for categories and times
Heatmaps showing call frequencies by hour and day
Trends over time
